# Exploring Online Algorithms for Causal Bandits
This repository contains the code for our CS747 course project on online learning algorithms for causal bandits. You can find our project proposal [here](proposal.pdf)

## Description
This project explores the Causal Bandit problems and various learning algorithms to solve such problem formulation for various graph topologies while minimizing the cummulative regret.

Also we explore a new model-based approcah to the problem which is using epsilon-greedy strategy with maintaining a similar Bayesian Graph as the true graph and updating as per exploration and in exploiting phase, acting greedily to the graph.



## Commands
Choose the graphs and algorithm you wanna test in plot.py file.
``` 
python3 plot.py
```
